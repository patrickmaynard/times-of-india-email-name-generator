The Times of India has a really weird policy of not sharing reporter/editor emails on bio pages. Since a lot of my time as a freelancer is spent getting contacts for pitches, I found this extremely obnoxious. 

So I dug around a bit and found what appears to be the email naming pattern most common in the company. A small script churned out a bunch of likely emails, which can be found in emails.md.

Update: A lot of the generated emails bounced back when I sent a query about who to pitch to. But not all of them did, so this list appears to have some value perhaps.
